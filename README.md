Hello all, this is a self supported project I took on just to help give the restaurant I work with
a working website, and one that can be hosted on its own accord without having to pay other companies
exorbitant amounts of money to use their software, for a single static page website.

I will be contributing to this over time as I learn how to use HTML/CSS better.  This was constructed by myself with 
the help of some self learning videos online and other resources.  The code is open to use if anyone wants to copy 
for themselves, as I learned how to do this for free, so it would only be fair to reciprocate and allow others to 
use it as well freely.  

If you like what you see, I am happy to work with others and expanding my knowledge of how to improve and make better
websites. Ultimately  I would like to make more websites with more functionality and customization options. 

The next steps planned for this website are:
- More accurate placements of photos with better descriptions
- A toggle mode or alternative link for vision impaired
- Focus mode to zoom in on pictures
- Improved mobile layout for easier scrolling on smaller devices

After these are implemented I will continue to find more and create further improvements.  Thank you for
your support and hope you can enjoy the website.
